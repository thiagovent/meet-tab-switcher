# meet-tab-switcher
A simple Chrome extension with a single purpose: activate the meeting tab.

## How to Use
Just install it in your browser by accessing the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/meet-tab-switcher/jjlihamcdgnccbefjbjkidaaaickgjcg).
After installation, pin the extension icon in the extension panel for easy access.

## How it Works
When you click the icon, if no meet.google.com tabs are open, a message saying "No open meetings" will be displayed.

If you have only one Meet tab open, it will be activated automatically.

If you have two or more tabs, it will list all the tabs with their titles, and the currently active tab will be highlighted.
